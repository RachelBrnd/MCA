<p align="center">Here are images of the first page of sheet music for the track Chicago. The first represents the version of the track
as notated for this project, the second shows this track after going through transformations. The track was first transformed to WAV, then opened in SonicVisualiser and transformed into
MIDI, which was then reopened in the notation software MuseScore. The audio for this transcription is mostly unrecognisable as the software's accuracy is hindered by the inclusion of six instruments. 
The images show that their notations are extremely different (although the tempo remains the same) - the transcription includes only one instrument, has changes to its time signature and has lost the lyrics and title text.
The transcription is therefore extremely inaccurate and would be unsuitable for further study or entry into digital collections.

This is just the first page of each notation, however if you wish to view images of the full track and the full write-up you can them in my <a href="https://github.com/RachelBrnd/MCA">GitHub repository</a>.
