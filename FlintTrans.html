<p align="center">Here are images of the first page of sheet music for the track Flint (For the Unemployed and Underpaid). The first represents the version of the track
as notated for this project, the second shows this track after going through transformations. The track was first transformed to WAV, then opened in SonicVisualiser and transformed into
MIDI, which was then reopened in the notation software MuseScore. The resultant track sounds somewhat similar to the original, perhaps due to the simplicity of the track. You can view
both below - their notations are noticeably different with changes to time signature and the loss of the opening text and lyrics.
