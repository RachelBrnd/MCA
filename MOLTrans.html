<p align="center">Here are images of the first page of sheet music for the track Mystery of Love. The first represents the version of the track
as notated for this project, the second shows this track after going through transformations. The track was first transformed to WAV, then opened in SonicVisualiser and transformed into
MIDI, which was then reopened in the notation software MuseScore. There are hints of the original track coming through when listening to 
the transcribed version, although the sheet music is unrecognisable and potentially unplayable in practice.
The images show that their notations are noticeably different with changes to its time signature and tempo and the loss of the lyrics and title text.

This is just the first page of each notation, however if you wish to view images of the full track you can find all images in my <a href="https://github.com/RachelBrnd/MCA">GitHub repository</a>.
