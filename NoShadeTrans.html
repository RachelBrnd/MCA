<p align="center">Here are images of the first page of sheet music for the track No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross. The first represents the version of the track
as notated for this project, the second shows this track after going through transformations. The track was first transformed to WAV, then opened in SonicVisualiser and transformed into
MIDI, which was then reopened in the notation software MuseScore. The resultant track sounds very vaguely similar to the original, although the inclusion of two staves likey hindered the accuracy of the transcription.
The images show that their notations are noticeably different as the tempo has increased dramatically and the lyrics and opening text have been lost.

This is just the first page of each notation, however if you wish to view images of the full track you can find all images in my <a href="https://github.com/RachelBrandie/MCA">GitHub repository</a>.
