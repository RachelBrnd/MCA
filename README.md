# Music Curation and Analytics 2018

Hello and welcome to my music analytics project, focusing on the music of American singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens. 
Data about Sufjan’s music exists online in all three forms – notated, descriptive and acoustic. Notated data can be found in user-generated sheet music 
on sites such as Musescore (which can be downloaded in XML, PDF and MUZC format) and on commercial sheet music sites (typically in PDF format). 
Acoustic data is found commonly in mp3 file format and in videos on Youtube, these recordings include found of both studio and live performances 
which creates depth in the data. Official acoustic music data files, such as mp3s, can be found for download on major online music retailers such as Amazon, iTunes and Bandcamp. 
Descriptive data about Stevens’ music exists in the form of reviews, fan sites, and on his own websites. His Bandcamp perhaps holds the most accurate data about his various albums,
 including track names, lengths, lyrics, artists notes, performers, recording locations and release dates. 
 Data about Sufjan has not been widely analysed or visualised, perhaps due to lack of mainstream interest in the artist. Nonetheless some amateur analyists have sought to present his data in colour visualisations or
 by word-frequency charts that count the lyrical content of his songs. 
In this project I have notated four Sufjan tracks, including the epic Chicago, which is arranged in six parts. You can view these notations on the site via my index page.
The content on this site is just a small part of the work done for this project, please view my GitHub repository the full 18 part dataset!
