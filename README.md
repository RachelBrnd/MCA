# Music Curation and Analytics 2018

Hello and welcome to my music analytics project, 
focusing on the music of American singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens. Data about Sufjan’s music exists online in all three forms: notated, 
descriptive and acoustic. Notated data can be found in user-generated sheet music on sites such as Musescore 
(which can be downloaded in musicXML, PDF and MUCZ format) and on commercial sheet music sites (typically in PDF format).
 Acoustic data is found commonly in MP3 file format and in videos on Youtube, these recordings include found of both studio 
 and live performances which creates depth in the data. Official acoustic music data files, such as MP3s, can be found for 
 download on major online music retailers such as Amazon, iTunes and Bandcamp. Descriptive data about Stevens’ music exists
 primarily in text form in many places including fan sites, music news outlets and on his own websites. His Bandcamp perhaps
 holds the most accurate data about his various albums, including track names, lengths, lyrics, artists notes, performers,
 recording locations, license info and release dates.
 Descriptive data is also attached to acoustic data in places where his music is available to buy and listen to 
 (such as Spotify and itunes)- which eases searching for the consumer.
 
 Data about Sufjan has not been widely analysed or visualised,
 perhaps due to lack of mainstream interest in the artist. Nonetheless some amateur analyists have sought to
 present his music data in by word-frequency charts that count the lyrical content of his songs, or in the wider project by
 Jax De Leon in "Illinois:Visualising Music", where Sufjan tracks were analysed and visualised in various different ways -
 revealing common lyrical and instrumental themes. While De Leon's graphics are visually impressive, they are somewhat hard to
 analyse for individual characterstics due to their scope - although they do reveal interesting patterns in Sufjan’s lyricism and 
 instrumentation.

I have created a website comprising of four notations of Sufjan Stevens songs, along with metadata and various audio and notational analyses. 
There are also four additional versions of the track "Chicago" with edited MEI, which show how edits to MEI are displayed!
On this site you can find the majority (but not all!) of the 
content of this project's dataset. To view all of the data please view "Project Files" in my GitHub repository!
