<p align="center">One benefit of time-frequency analysis over a traditional waveform is that it
allows us to see more easily the presence of a variety of instruments or voices. 
Take, for example, the track &quot;Wake Up&quot; from the Free Music Archive.
  This images shows the intro of the track moving into the first verse. While both visualisations indicate a change in sound at the end of the intro 
  (around the 7 second mark), the time-frequency analysis indicates this more clearly. It also shows that the change
  in sound involves a change in the level and density of the frequencies via many orange tones in the visual.
  This can suggest the presence of multiple instruments or voices &#8208; which cannot be seen in the waveform. The waveform analysis,when viewed at this level,
  can show changes in volume/energy clearly and when zoomed in to view in closer detail it may reveal pitch information &#8208; although this is extremely difficult to 
  understand by eye alone.
