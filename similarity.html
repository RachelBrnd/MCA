<p align="center">The below visuals help us to calculate the similarity between 10 tracks in three different genres. Tracks 0-3 were classical, 4-6 were rock and 7-9 were electronic. Each track was downloaded from <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org">the Free Music Archive</a>

<img src="SiteImages/similarity/A and C occ.png" height="100%" width="100%"></td><td align="right">This visual shows the relative occurance of A and C notes in the tracks.<br> From this
one notices that the classical tracks are very similar <br>in their occurances of these notes. The rock tracks are also generally similar,<br> although one track has a much higher occurance of A notes than the other two.<br> 
Two of the electronic tracks are closely related, although one has a <br>similar occurance of A notes but a much higher occurance of C notes than the other two.</td></tr></table>

<h3 align="center">Notes A and C Distance</h3><table align="center"><tr><td>
<img src="SiteImages/similarity/A and C similarity.png" height="100%" width="100%" align="left"></td><td align="right">This graph shows the distance between tracks, in terms of their<br> relative occurrance of A and C notes, the warmer the square is - the further<br> apart the tracks. We can
observe groupings between the classical <br>tracks (0-3) by the dark section in the upper left corner. Elsewhere, <br>tracks 3 (classical) and 9 (electronic) are the most dissimilar, <br>with a distance of nearly 1.o between them.</td></tr></table>

<img src="SiteImages/similarity/All Notes Similarity.png" height="100%" width="100%" align="left"></td><td align="right">This visual shows the distance between tracks when looking at the occurance of all notes.<br> It's patterns are similar to those visible in the above graph,
which only analyses <br>A and C notes. This suggests that analysis of just two notes can be an accurate indicator<br> of the closeness of different pieces of music.</td></tr><table>
